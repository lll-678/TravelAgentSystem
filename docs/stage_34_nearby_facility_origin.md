# Stage 34 Nearby Facility Origin Selection

## Scope

This stage fixes the nearby-facility workflow against requirement `(3) 场所查询`.

The backend can rank facilities by graph distance, and the frontend now lets the user select a current place or map point before querying.

## Delivered

- `GET /api/v1/facilities/nearby` accepts `origin_place_id`.
- Backend resolves `building-*`, `facility-*`, and `node-*` origins.
- Response includes `origin`, `category_query`, resolved category, route distance, route path, and trace.
- NearbyFacilitiesPage has a campus origin selector powered by `GET /api/v1/search/places?scope=campus`.
- AMapView supports an origin marker and emits map-click coordinates.
- Map clicks are converted from GCJ-02 to backend WGS84 before query.
- Coordinate origin remains available in a debug panel.
- Smoke now verifies nearby-facility search with `origin_place_id`.

## Requirement Mapping

| Requirement | Target Behavior | Current State | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Select a scenic/campus place and find nearby facilities in a range | User chooses an origin place such as library, gate, canteen, building, facility, or map click | Implemented | n/a |
| Filter by category | User chooses facility category before search | Implemented | n/a |
| Input category name and sort by distance | User can type `厕所/卫生间/超市/食堂`, backend resolves category and ranks by real walking distance | Implemented | n/a |
| Distance is not straight-line | Backend runs Dijkstra and Top-K over route distance | Implemented | n/a |

## Product Flow

```text
MapGuidePage
  -> user selects a campus place/facility/building or clicks map
  -> NearbyFacilitiesPage receives origin
  -> user selects or types a facility category
  -> backend filters candidates by category
  -> backend runs Dijkstra route distance from origin to each candidate
  -> backend returns Top-K facilities with routePath
  -> frontend marks origin, facilities, and selected route on AMap
```

NearbyFacilitiesPage should also work independently:

```text
origin selector: GET /api/v1/search/places?scope=campus
category input: dropdown + free text
radius input: meters
result table: facility name, resolved category, route distance, duration
map: origin marker, facility markers, route polyline
```

## API Contract

Extended:

```text
GET /api/v1/facilities/nearby
```

Preferred parameters:

```text
origin_place_id=building-33 | facility-123 | node-184
category=超市
radius=800
limit=10
```

Coordinate fallback remains for map clicks and debugging:

```text
current_lng=116.28333
current_lat=40.15608
```

Response should include:

```text
origin.id
origin.name
origin.lng
origin.lat
category_query
category
items[].distance
items[].duration
items[].routePath
algorithm_trace.origin_resolution
algorithm_trace.category_lookup
algorithm_trace.distance
algorithm_trace.ranking
```

## Dataset Boundary

- `campus_navigation`: school-internal buildings, semantic nodes, and campus POIs; used for origin selection and strict campus demo.
- `nearby_facilities`: school-surrounding facilities; used for surrounding-service recommendation.
- Stage 34 fixes the interaction with the current `facilities` table. A later data-model hardening stage should add an explicit `dataset`/`scope` column if we need strict separation in queries.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] User can choose origin from campus place search.
- [x] User can set origin by clicking the map.
- [x] User can still use coordinate fallback from an advanced/debug panel.
- [x] Query sends selected origin to backend instead of silently using fixed BUPT center.
- [x] Backend accepts `origin_place_id` and resolves it through the same campus place model used by route planning.
- [x] Category can be selected or typed in Chinese.
- [x] Result shows resolved category, real route distance, duration, and routePath.
- [x] Map shows origin marker, facility markers, and selected route.
- [x] `algorithm_trace` explains category lookup, Dijkstra graph distance, and Top-K heap ranking.
