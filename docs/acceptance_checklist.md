- [x] Behavior logs are recorded after browsing/rating/favorite actions.

## Destinations And Recommendations

- [x] Destination list supports attraction/school category filter and sorting.
- [x] Destination seed uses real China attraction/university names and approximate coordinates.
- [ ] Destination detail shows rating, popularity, tags, description, related diaries.
- [x] Search supports attraction/school name/category/keyword.
- [x] Home shows personalized Top 10 attraction/school recommendations.
- [x] Recommendation response includes score and reason.
- [x] Recommendation candidate pool is destination records, not raw campus buildings or facilities.
- [x] User interests can represent preferred attraction and school categories before recommendation.

## Map And Routing

- [x] Navigation scope is school/campus internal after a campus destination is selected.
- [x] Map page displays roads, buildings, and facilities.
- [x] Map page scaffold uses AMap JS API for rendering.
- [x] Backend map data and route topology boundary is documented as OSMnx/OpenStreetMap, not AMap routing.
- [x] AMap default center is `[116.28333, 40.15608]` for 北京邮电大学沙河校区.
- [x] Backend GeoJSON coordinate contract is documented as `[lng, lat]` arrays for AMap overlays.
- [x] AMap overlays convert backend WGS84 coordinates to GCJ-02 before rendering.
- [x] `GET /api/v1/map/geojson` returns roads, buildings, facilities, categories, statistics, and GeoJSON from local DB rows.
- [ ] Place search highlights a map item.
- [x] Facility markers open an info window on click in `AMapView`.
- [x] Building polygons clear old overlays before filters redraw.
- [x] Single-route planning returns path steps, distance, time, and mode.
- [x] Single-route planning uses local `map_nodes` / `map_edges` and Dijkstra instead of mock route data.
- [x] Route target can be selected by destination/place/facility name, not only typed coordinates.
- [x] User-facing walking route planning can use AMap walking directions for real route geometry.
- [x] Route API keeps `local_graph` mode for Dijkstra demonstration and network-free tests.
- [x] Shortest-time routing uses per-edge congestion where real speed = congestion * ideal speed.
- [x] Route planning filters by transport mode: walking, bicycle, electric cart, and mixed mode.
- [x] Route scaffold is drawn as polyline on map.
- [x] Route drawing calls fit-view behavior after rendering.
- [x] Optional AMap browser smoke harness exists and skips cleanly when `VITE_AMAP_KEY` or Playwright is unavailable.
- [x] Multi-point planning returns optimized order and closed loop.
- [x] Nearby facilities are sorted by graph distance, not straight-line distance.
- [x] Nearby facility query filters by category before route-distance ranking.
- [x] Nearby facility query returns Top-K results with route paths for AMap drawing.
- [x] Nearby facility query supports category-name text input and fuzzy category lookup.

## Indoor Navigation

- [x] User can attach image/video media metadata to diary.
- [x] Diary detail increments views.
- [x] User can rate/comment on diary.
- [x] Title exact search uses an indexed exact lookup instead of generic contains matching.
