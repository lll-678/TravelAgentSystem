## Map And Routing

- [ ] Map page displays roads, buildings, and facilities.

- [x] Facility markers open an info window on click in `AMapView`.
- [x] Building polygons clear old overlays before filters redraw.
- [x] Single-route planning returns path steps, distance, time, and mode.
- [x] Single-route planning uses seeded `map_nodes` / `map_edges` and Dijkstra instead of mock route data.
- [x] Route scaffold is drawn as polyline on map.
- [x] Route drawing calls fit-view behavior after rendering.
- [ ] Multi-point planning returns optimized order and closed loop.
- [x] Nearby facilities are sorted by graph distance, not straight-line distance.
